# Substrate Node Template

A fresh FRAME-based [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) node, ready for hacking :rocket:

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the Node Template :hammer_and_wrench:

### Rust Setup

First, complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](./doc/rust-setup.md).

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --dev --tmp
```

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Embedded Docs

Once the project has been built, the following command can be used to explore all parameters and
subcommands:

```sh
./target/release/node-template -h
```

## Run

The provided `cargo run` command will launch a temporary node and its state will be discarded after
you terminate the process. After the project has been built, there are other ways to launch the
node.

### Single-Node Development Chain

This command will start the single-node development chain with persistent state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template --dev
```

Purge the development chain's state:

```bash
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev
```

Start the development chain with detailed logging:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -lruntime=debug --dev
```

### Multi-Node Local Testnet

If you want to see the multi-node consensus algorithm in action, refer to
[our Start a Private Network tutorial](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/start-a-private-network/).

## Template Structure

A Substrate project such as this consists of a number of components that are spread across a few
directories.

### Node

A blockchain node is an application that allows users to participate in a blockchain network.
Substrate-based blockchain nodes expose a number of capabilities:

-   Networking: Substrate nodes use the [`libp2p`](https://libp2p.io/) networking stack to allow the
    nodes in the network to communicate with one another.
-   Consensus: Blockchains must have a way to come to
    [consensus](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus) on the state of the
    network. Substrate makes it possible to supply custom consensus engines and also ships with
    several consensus mechanisms that have been built on top of
    [Web3 Foundation research](https://research.web3.foundation/en/latest/polkadot/NPoS/index.html).
-   RPC Server: A remote procedure call (RPC) server is used to interact with Substrate nodes.

There are several files in the `node` directory - take special note of the following:

-   [`chain_spec.rs`](./node/src/chain_spec.rs): A
    [chain specification](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/chain-spec) is a
    source code file that defines a Substrate chain's initial (genesis) state. Chain specifications
    are useful for development and testing, and critical when architecting the launch of a
    production chain. Take note of the `development_config` and `testnet_genesis` functions, which
    are used to define the genesis state for the local development chain configuration. These
    functions identify some
    [well-known accounts](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/integrate/subkey#well-known-keys)
    and use them to configure the blockchain's initial state.
-   [`service.rs`](./node/src/service.rs): This file defines the node implementation. Take note of
    the libraries that this file imports and the names of the functions it invokes. In particular,
    there are references to consensus-related topics, such as the
    [longest chain rule](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus#longest-chain-rule),
    the [Aura](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus#aura) block authoring
    mechanism and the
    [GRANDPA](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/consensus#grandpa) finality
    gadget.

After the node has been [built](#build), refer to the embedded documentation to learn more about the
capabilities and configuration parameters that it exposes:

```shell
./target/release/node-template --help
```

### Runtime

In Substrate, the terms
"[runtime](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#runtime)" and
"[state transition function](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/glossary#stf-state-transition-function)"
are analogous - they refer to the core logic of the blockchain that is responsible for validating
blocks and executing the state changes they define. The Substrate project in this repository uses
the [FRAME](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/frame) framework to construct a
blockchain runtime. FRAME allows runtime developers to declare domain-specific logic in modules
called "pallets". At the heart of FRAME is a helpful
[macro language](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/macros) that makes it easy to
create pallets and flexibly compose them to create blockchains that can address
[a variety of needs](https://www.substrate.io/substrate-users/).

Review the [FRAME runtime implementation](./runtime/src/lib.rs) included in this template and note
the following:

-   This file configures several pallets to include in the runtime. Each pallet configuration is
    defined by a code block that begins with `impl $PALLET_NAME::Config for Runtime`.
-   The pallets are composed into a single runtime by way of the
    [`construct_runtime!`](https://crates.parity.io/frame_support/macro.construct_runtime.html)
    macro, which is part of the core
    [FRAME Support](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/frame#support-library)
    library.

### Pallets

The runtime in this project is constructed using many FRAME pallets that ship with the
[core Substrate repository](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame) and a
template pallet that is [defined in the `pallets`](./pallets/template/src/lib.rs) directory.

A FRAME pallet is compromised of a number of blockchain primitives:

-   Storage: FRAME defines a rich set of powerful
    [storage abstractions](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/storage) that makes
    it easy to use Substrate's efficient key-value database to manage the evolving state of a
    blockchain.
-   Dispatchables: FRAME pallets define special types of functions that can be invoked (dispatched)
    from outside of the runtime in order to update its state.
-   Events: Substrate uses [events](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/events) to
    notify users of important changes in the runtime.
-   Errors: When a dispatchable fails, it returns an error.
-   Config: The `Config` configuration interface is used to define the types and parameters upon
    which a FRAME pallet depends.

### Run in Docker

First, install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and
[Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

Then run the following command to start a single node development chain.

```bash
./scripts/docker_run.sh
```

This command will firstly compile your code, and then start a local development network. You can
also replace the default command (`cargo build --release && ./target/release/node-template --dev --ws-external`)
by appending your own. A few useful ones are as follow.

```bash
# Run Substrate node without re-compiling
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/node-template --dev --ws-external

# Purge the local dev chain
./scripts/docker_run.sh ./target/release/node-template purge-chain --dev

# Check whether the code is compilable
./scripts/docker_run.sh cargo check
```


### Benchmark


```bash
cargo build --release --features runtime-benchmarks
```

weights.rs:

```bash
./target/release/node-template benchmark \
    --chain dev \
    --execution wasm \
    --wasm-execution compiled \
    --pallet pallet_template \
    --extrinsic '*' \
    --steps 20 \
    --repeat 10 \
    --raw \
    --output ./pallets/template/src/weights.rs
```

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/node-template -lruntime=debug --dev
```


### Start a private chain

### 1. Chain Spec:

```bash
# Export the local chain spec to json
./target/release/node-template build-spec --disable-default-bootnode --chain local > customSpec.json
```

### 2. generate keys
keystore.txt

### 3. edit customeSpec.json
      "palletAura": {
        "authorities": [
          "5HBpKCqEYtCQ1gmCbkf1LKRLPMEY2vnDQH2qviphXn3BD6jC",
          "5GxHNR9DZa4KEZnJm9UyYo5mLbfVWPfuw8HwDPGwJvHSnNRa"
        ]
      },
      "palletGrandpa": {
        "authorities": [
          ["5HhFjcAvtzpod1aQPMibF2NQtmX7n4Udf4M4RHDGiK4Pj65Y", 1],
          ["5CeSrafRJ51Hh4EdjkR6CraD2eq5Tvz7PidxXBP4qu8v4TWa", 1]
        ]
      },
      ...
      "palletSudo": {
        "key": "5HBpKCqEYtCQ1gmCbkf1LKRLPMEY2vnDQH2qviphXn3BD6jC"
      }      


### 4.  Export raw json
```bash
./target/release/node-template build-spec --chain=customSpec.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > customSpecRaw.json 
```
    
### start Peer1
```bash
#  first blockchain node
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/node01 --chain local -y

./target/release/node-template \
--base-path /tmp/node01 \
--chain ./customSpecRaw.json \
--port 30333 \
--ws-port 9945 \
--rpc-port 9933 \
--telemetry-url "wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0" \
--validator \
--rpc-methods Unsafe \
--name MyNode01

```

# node1 [add private key](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9945#/rpc)

### start Peer2
```bash
# add a second node
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/node02 --chain local -y

# purge chain (only required for new/modified dev chain spec)
./target/release/node-template purge-chain --base-path /tmp/node02 --chain local -y

# start node02
./target/release/node-template \
  --base-path /tmp/node02 \
  --chain ./customSpecRaw.json \
  --port 30334 \
  --ws-port 9946 \
  --rpc-port 9934 \
  --telemetry-url 'wss://telemetry.polkadot.io/submit/ 0' \
  --validator \
  --rpc-methods Unsafe \
  --name MyNode02 \
  --bootnodes /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/30333/p2p/<Peer1 ID>

```

# node2 [add private key](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://127.0.0.1:9946#/rpc)
